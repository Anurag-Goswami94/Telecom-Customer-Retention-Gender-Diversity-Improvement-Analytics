Conclusion: - 

As we can see from the analysis that the hiring of female employees is much lesser comparative to male employees. So, this is the main reason for the gender imbalance in the organization. Few suggestions to solve this issue are: - 

# Rise the hiring of Female employee in the organization by 3%-5%. This will bring in more female talents in the organization and lower the imbalance.
 
# Hire or promote females also to the level of Executive so the management toward the female employees are also looked at and the females also will get a chance to be promoted to the higher hierarchy which will automatically build the balance in the job.
